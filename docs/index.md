### NLP - Analyzing and Improving ELECTRA Performance on Neutrally Labeled Premise/Hypothesis Pairs 

<!-- Hate speech detection is the automated task of determining whether a piece of text contains hateful content. In this project, I built a classifier using PyTorch to fine-tune a BERT model. -->

Pre-trained models that over-rely on popular annotated datasets, like SNLI and MNLI, can learn dataset specific "Artifacts". This hinders model generalization and leads to poor performance when deployed to production. In this paper, I build, train, analyze, and improve model performance on neutrally labelled Premise/Hypothesis pairs using the ELECTRA-Small model and HuggingFace Transformers library.
